# Django-REST-client-registration
REST client registration
These files are a core part of a client registration system for an online shop. It uses Django REST framework, django-rest-auth, PostgreSQL.
To use these files you would need to start a Django project, and a Django app inside that project and add/replace the code.
I am a main contributor of this project.
