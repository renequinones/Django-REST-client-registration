REST client registration
These files are a core part of a client registration system for an online shop. 

Technologies
It uses Django REST framework, django-rest-auth, PostgreSQL.

How to use the code in the files
To use these files you would need to start a Django project, and a Django app inside that project and add/replace the code. The urlproj.py file contains the code that goes in the url.py file at the project level. The file named plainly url.py contains the endpoint of the client app.
